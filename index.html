    <h1 class="text-center">Make This In An Hour</h1>
    <p>One of my friends has been saying for a couple months that he would make his
    website over spring break.  Now it's the end of spring break and he hasn't
    started.  His birthday is tomorrow, and I've decided to be an <s>asshole</s>
    good friend and give the gift of accountability by writing down step-by-step
    instructions to make it as simple as possible.</p>

    <p>It really only takes an hour to make a website.  I know because I timed
    myself doing the following and the whole process took me just under an hour
    to make this website.  (I even did the registering a new domain and
    creating a new Github account for a good measure!)  You can view the code
    for this website on <a
      href="http://github.com/smilli/makethisinanhour">Github</a>.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Go to <a href="http://namecheap.com">namecheap.com</a> and register a
      domain.  This is optional and only if you want a custom domain name.</li>
      <li>Make a <a href="https://github.com/join">Github account</a> and
      download <a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads">Git</a> if you haven't
      already.</li>
      <li>Create a directory to hold your website and cd into it.  <code>mkdir my-site && cd
        my-site</code>.  All future commands will assume you are within this
      directory.</li>
      <li>Make <a href="https://github.com/new">a new Github repository</a> for your site titled
      yourusername.github.io.  For example, my Github account is smilli, so my
      repository is named smilli.github.io.</li>
      <li>While in the directory for your website run <code>git init</code> and
      <code>git remote add origin
        https://github.com/username/username.github.io.git</code> with username
      replaced by your username.
		<ul>
			<li>Alternatively, you can just pull your online repositiry with <code>git clone https://github.com/username/username.github.io.git</code> with username
      replaced by your username.</li>
		</ul>
      </li>
      <li>Make a file called "index.html" in your website's folder with the HTML
      for your main page.  Don't spend long on this; it can be as simple as the following:</li>
<pre>
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;YOUR SITE TITLE&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;-- Add some style to your site, see http://getbootstrap.com for details --&gt;
  &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot;
  href=&quot;https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.4/css/bootstrap.min.css&quot;&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;YOUR SITE TITLE&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Your text blahblahbhalbha&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Another paragraph!  Maybe more text!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</pre>
      <li>Enter whatever text or html you want in the file.  You can view the
      changes you're making locally by running <code>python -m
        SimpleHTTPServer 8000</code> and then navigating to
      http://localhost:8000 in your browser.</li>
      <li>Now run the following commands:
<pre>
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push -u origin master
</pre>
      </li>
      <li>Go to http://yourusername.github.io.  You should now see your site!
      Congratulations, you put something online.
      </li>
      <li>If you want to add your own domain name, create a file called "CNAME" in
      all caps.  Then add a single line that says 'yourdomainname.com' (no http
      or www) to the file.  For example the CNAME file for this website looks like this:
<pre>
makethisinanhour.com
</pre>
      View details on <a
        href="https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-cname-file-to-your-repository/">CNAME
        configuration</a> here.</li>
      <li>Like before, push your changes to Github.
<pre>
git add .
git commit -m "Add CNAME"
git push
</pre>
      </li>
      <li>Now login to http://namecheap.com and click
        on the domain you want under <a
        href="https://manage.www.namecheap.com/myaccount/domain-list.asp?from=memberhome">the
        list of your domains</a>.  The list of domains should look like this:

        <img src="/img/yourdomains.png"/>

        <p>After clicking on your domain, you should see a link that says "All Host
        Records" on the left sidebar underneath "Host Management".  Click this.
        Now you should see the default records that Namecheap adds for your
        site.</p>

        <img src="/img/oldrecords.png"/>

        <p>Modify your records to look like this (with username replaced by your
        username of course):</p>

        <img src="img/records.png"/>
      </li>
      <li>
        After the DNS changes propagate, you will be able to see
      your website on your domain!  Congrats :)
